ATGroups
========

Delphi component.

It's used in SynWrite text editor as app skeleton. It contains 6 page-controls, each based on ATTabs, and maniupulates these pages: depending on Mode prop, it makes visible one, two, three etc pages, with splitters between them, so you can resize pages. Also 2x2 and 3x2 grid modes exist (some splitters are sync'ed). Allows to drag-drop tabs between all pages. Tested with TMemo as editor control, of course can be used with other memos or frames. Allows to use SpTBX to theme splitters and ATTabs.
